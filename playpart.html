            <p>[With warmth.]</p>
            <p> I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have it out this evening with--<p>[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]</p>--with him--with the chief.</p>
            <h6>KAIA.</h6><p>[Anxiously.]</p><p> Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!</p>
            <h6>RAGNAR.</h6><p>Yes, better wait, father!</p>
            <h6>BROVIK.</h6><p>[Draws is breath laboriously.]</p>

            <h6>KAIA.</h6><p>[Listening.]</p><p> Hush! I hear him on the stairs.</p>
            <p> [All three go back to their work.  A short silence.
                HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door.  He is a man no
                longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly
                hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows.  He wears a
                greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and
                broad lapels.  On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,
                and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.]</p>
            <h6>SOLNESS.</h6><p>[Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen's office, and asks in a whisper:]</p><p>Are they gone?</p>
            <h6>KAIA.</h6>
            <p>[Softly, shaking her]</p><p>No.</p>
            <p>[She takes the shade off her eyes.  SOLNESS crosses the room,throws his hat on a chair, places the portfolios on the table by the sofa, and approaches the desk again.  KAIA goes on writing without intermission, but seems nervous and uneasy.</p>
            <h6>SOLNESS.</h6>
            <p>[Aloud.]</p><p> What is that you are entering, Miss Fosli?</p>
