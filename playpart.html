                [With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
                it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with
                him--with the chief.</p>
            
            <p>KAIA.

                [Anxiously.] Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!</p>
            <p>RAGNAR.

                Yes, better wait, father!</p>
            <p>
                BROVIK.

                [Draws is breath laboriously.] Ha--ha--! _I_ haven't much time for
                waiting.</p>
            <p>KAIA.

                [Listening.] Hush! I hear him on the stairs.
                
                     [All three go back to their work.  A short silence.
                
                
                  HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door.  He is a man no
                  longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly
                  hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows.  He wears a
                  greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and
                  broad lapels.  On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,
                  and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.</p>
            <p>
                SOLNESS.

                [Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen's office, and asks in a
                whisper:] Are they gone?</p>
            <p>KAIA.

                [Softly, shaking her] No.
                
                     [She takes the shade off her eyes.  SOLNESS crosses the room,
                       throws his hat on a chair, places the portfolios on the table
                       by the sofa, and approaches the desk again.  KAIA goes on
                       writing without intermission, but seems nervous and uneasy.</p>
            <P>SOLNESS.

                [Aloud.] What is that you are entering, Miss Fosli?</P>
