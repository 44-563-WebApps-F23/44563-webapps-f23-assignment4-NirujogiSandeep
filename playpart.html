            <p>
            BROVIK.[Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?</p>
            <p>
            KAIA.Then take a little walk.</p>
            <p>
            RAGNAR.Yes, do. I will come with you.</p>
            <P>
            BROVIK.[With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with him--with the chief.</P>
